## Introduction
Azure OpenAI offers powerful tools and APIs for natural language processing, code generation, and multimodal tasks. In this repository, we’ll cover the following topics:

- **Chat Completion API**: Explore how to interact with OpenAI’s chat models.
- **Prompting Techniques**: Learn effective ways to prompt the models.
- **Model Configuration Parameters**: Understand how to fine-tune and optimize your models.
- **Assistant API**: Discover code interpretation and function calling capabilities.
- **Multimodal GPT-4-Turbo with Vision**: Combine text and images for exciting applications.

## Getting Started
Before diving into the notebooks, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

1. **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: Install VS Code, as we’ll be using it for editing and running the notebooks.
2. **Python Extension**: Ensure you have the Python extension installed in VS Code.
3. **Anaconda**: If you haven’t already, [install Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/windows/) on your local machine .
